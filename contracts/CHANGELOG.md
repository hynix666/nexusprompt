# Contract changelog

[ADR-0002](../Documentation/0002-contract-first-design.md) requires a version bump **and a
changelog entry** for every schema change. Versions have always lived in each schema's `$id`;
the changelog half had no artifact behind it until 2026-08-18. This file is that artifact.

Entries are newest first. A schema's version lives in its `$id` and is the authority — this
file records *why* a version moved, which the `$id` cannot.

Versioning, as applied here:

- **major** — a consumer reading the old shape breaks. Removing a field, tightening a type,
  making an optional field required.
- **minor** — additive. A new optional field; a widened enum.
- **patch** — wording only. Descriptions, examples, `$comment`. No shape change.

## 2026-08-18

### `observability-event` 1.0.0 → **1.1.0** (minor)

**Added** `STAGE_SKIPPED` to the `event_type` enum.

A skipped stage is a real thing the pipeline does and none of the eight existing types said
it. `DEGRADE` is wrong — a skip is a decision, not a failure — and leaving it unreported
would make "did not run" indistinguishable from "was never reached".

Found the worst way. The pipeline runner emitted events through
`sink.emit({ ... } as never)`, and that uncommented cast was hiding three violations at
once: the field is `event_type`, not `type`; five required fields were missing (`layer`,
`parent_event_id`, `schema_version` and the nullables); and `STAGE_SKIPPED` was not in the
enum. The conformance suite *does* validate events — but only ones the Orchestrator
produced, so nothing ever looked at the pipeline's. An escape hatch with no comment
justifying it turned out to be silencing exactly what it looked like it might be.

The cast is gone, the events are built from the contract shape, and a test now validates
every event a pipeline run emits against the required-field list and the enum.

*Migration:* none. Additive to an enum; existing consumers see a type they may not know,
which is why the field was an enum rather than a free string.

### `comparison` 1.0.0 → **2.0.0** (major)

**Removed** `detectors_equalized` (boolean). **Added** `equalization` (object), now required.

The boolean was never computed. Every occurrence carrying a value was a test, hardcoded
`true`; the runner never set it at all. So the comparator's strongest guard — the one that
makes it refuse rather than report a number — was a field the caller filled in.

`equalization` is derived from both runs' measured recall blocks and carries the evidence:
`max_gap`, the derived `gap_bound`, `effective_recall`, `adjusted_resolution`, and the
per-detector figures.

The boolean was deleted rather than kept alongside. Retaining it would have made this an
additive minor bump and left **two sources of truth for one fact**, one of them a summary
readable without consulting the evidence. That property — readable without being checked —
is what let the guard go unverified. Preserving it for compatibility would have preserved
the defect. Nothing outside this repository consumes these schemas.

*Migration:* replace `detectors_equalized: true` with the `equalization` object emitted by
`compare()`. Callers no longer pass equalization in; they pass both runs' `detector_recall`
blocks and the comparator derives it.

### `eval-run` 1.0.0 → **1.1.0** (minor)

**Added** optional, nullable `detector_recall`: per-detector `substrates`, `probes_run`,
`probes_detected`, `recall`, plus `probe_corpus_version`.

Recall is a property of **(detector, configuration)**, not of a detector alone — the finding
this whole change exists to encode. `eval-run` is where it belongs because a run already pins
the configuration, which makes a stale pairing structurally impossible.

Optional and nullable rather than required, so the bump stays additive. A run may legitimately
exist without recall; it simply cannot be *compared*, and the comparator enforces that. The
wording follows `grader_health`: absence is a known-unknown, never a pass.

`recall` is nullable because `probes_run` can be 0 when a run offers no substrate. Null means
*not measurable*; 0 means *measured and dead*. They take different paths — one refuses the
comparison, the other fails the build — and collapsing them would fail the build for the
wrong reason.

## Before 2026-08-18

No entries. Thirteen schemas landed across the contract-first work with version bumps recorded
only in their `$id`s. Reconstructing those entries after the fact would produce a changelog
asserting things nobody verified at the time, which is the failure mode this repository keeps
finding in its own documentation. The gap is left visible instead.
